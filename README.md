 RK-Collections wanted to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that they can understand their customers & grow more sales in 2023.

After processing, cleaning & analyzing this data I got some interesting insights :

Insights from  report include:

-a huge number of sales are made in March,

-women are more likely to buy than men (~65%), 

-Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%),

-adults aged between 30 to 49 years old are the major contributors (~50%), 

-and Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are the largest contributors (~80%).

 - Conclusion to improve sales: Targeting women clients in the 30-49 age range who live in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh with offers/ads/coupons from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra would help the business develop even more.
